Code Documentation for "The Series Analyzer":




** In MAX,MIN,SUM,AVERAGE,NUMBEROFELEMENTS,SUM function we already made sure that the array and its values are valid, so we dont make these validations inside the functions.

* MAX function: This function gets the whole array as input ( external argument ) and using "for" loop find the maximum integer value in the array.
		The function initialized with the value max=0, then it compares it with every element in the series. If the element is greater than the variable's "max" value, max gets 
		the same element value.

* MIN function: This function gets the whole array as input ( external argument ) and using "for" loop find the minimum integer value in the array.
		The function initialized with the value min=$1 (the first element's value in the array), then it compares it with every element in the series. If the element is smaller
		than the variable's "min" value, max gets the same element value.

* AVERAGE func.:In this function we add the whole elements of the array to the "average" variable using for loop, then its divided by the the number of elements in the array.

* NUMBEROFELEMENTS func. : This function basically returns ( echoes ) the "$#" value which holds the numbers of elements in the array.

* SUM function: This function is initialized with sum=0, using for loop it adds every elements in the array to the "sum" value. At the end we get the whole sum of the array in "sum" value
